# Deep learning project

## Installation

Makes sure you install all dependencies. This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and virtualization. If you don't have poetry installed (and don't want to install it), check `pyproject.toml` for the dependencies and install them manually using pip.

```bash
poetry install
```
